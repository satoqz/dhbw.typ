# DHBW Thesis Template

A thesis template for work at DHBW created in [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst),
focused on extreme simplicity and hackability.

Since different supervisors and different kinds of theses at DHBW usually require slightly
different setups, I've ultimately found it infeasible to support all possible permutations
from within a single template function, which is how most Typst templates work. Instead,
this template provides an example/reference setup that you can copy-paste and tweak to
your needs.

> **Note:**
> This template is only intended for students of the faculty of technology, specifially
> computer science students. Especially if you're part of the faculty of economics, you
> should probably consult a lawyer before you even type a single character.
